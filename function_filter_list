#Each person in the group programmed one question, then looked over the others to make sure they made sense

def func_three(list_three, y): #y is the argument you give
    final_list = [] #since the answer needs to be in a list, we need to define a list to return
    for i in range(0,len(list_three)):

            final_list.append(list_three[i]) #if the value is less than y, it will append to the list
