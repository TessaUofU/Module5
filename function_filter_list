#Question 3
#Each person in the group programmed one question, then looked over the others to make sure they made sense
""""Write a python program that, given an input list, will filter the input above a user defined threshold. This is to be done with a standard function.
That is, given a list [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], and an argument (6), it should return [1,2,3,4,5,6]"""
def func_three(list_three, y): #list_three is the list you give and y is the argument you give
    final_list = [] #since the answer needs to be in a list, we need to define a list to return
    for i in range(0,len(list_three)):
        if i < y:
            final_list.append(list_three[i]) #if the index value is less than y (item value), it will append to the list
            #so at index 5, the item will be 6, so everything indexed 0 to 5 will be printed in this question
    return final_list



print(func_three([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 6))
